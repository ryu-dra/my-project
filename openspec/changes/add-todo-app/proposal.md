## Why
We need a basic ToDo application to manage tasks with simple add, list, and done commands. This will provide a foundation for task management functionality with structured task data including task name and task details.

## What Changes
- Add new ToDo app capability with command-line interface
- Implement add command to create new tasks with task name and task details
- Implement list command to display all tasks with structured information
- Implement done command to mark tasks as completed
- Add persistent storage for tasks with enhanced data structure

## Impact
- Affected specs: todo-app (new capability)
- Affected code: New application files (main app, storage, commands)
